# Raytracer

A physics simulator that models and visualises the behaviour of light passing through various lens geometries.

'testing.py' contains code to run a variety of tests.
'System.py' should be used to run simulations.
'raytracer.py' and 'opticalequipment.py' do not need to be directly run to start a simulation.
